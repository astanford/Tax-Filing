# Extraction Request: Prior-Year Tax Return → Carryover JSON

*Hand this file (plus one tax-year's return PDFs) to the local extraction
agent (e.g., Hermes Agent). Its output is consumed by an automated
validator — follow the format exactly.*

## Task

Read the attached federal Form 1040 return (with schedules) and Georgia
Form 500 return for ONE tax year. Produce a single JSON document with the
fields below. Output ONLY the JSON — no prose, no markdown fences.

## Redaction Rules (hard requirements — output is machine-rejected on violation)

1. **NEVER include:** Social Security Numbers or ITINs/EINs (any format),
   bank account or routing numbers, dates of birth, phone numbers, email
   addresses, signatures, or taxpayer/spouse/dependent names.
2. Dollar amounts must be strings with cents, e.g., `"185000.00"` —
   never bare integers (a 9+ digit integer is auto-rejected as an
   account-like number).
3. Rental properties are identified ONLY by street label + LLC name,
   e.g., `"Rental (456 Oak Ave - Oak LLC)"` — no city/state/ZIP.
4. If a field is not on the return, use `null` or omit it. Never guess.

## Output Schema

request). Field-by-field source map:

  difference being tracked (GA Schedule 1 addbacks), if shown

### `state_refund_received_during_current_year`

### `rentals` — one entry per property on Schedule E Part I
- `property_label` — per redaction rule 3

  the return context; if unknown, use `"long_term"` and note it)

  from the Form 8582 worksheets (Worksheet 5/6/7); `"0.00"` if none

  - `description` (e.g., `"Building"`, `"HVAC replacement"`)
  - `placed_in_service` — `"YYYY-MM"`
  - `cost_basis` — depreciable basis
  - `land_value_excluded` — land portion excluded from basis (buildings)
  - `method_recovery` — e.g., `"SL/27.5 MM"`, `"200DB/5"`

  - `federal_bonus_claimed` — bonus depreciation taken on this asset (any year)

### `passthrough` — one entry per K-1 (Schedule E Part II)

- `qbi_passthrough_form_8995` — QBI from this entity (Form 8995/8995-A)

*Source K-1 line meanings vary by form (1065 vs 1120-S vs 1041); a curated
reference does not yet exist — verify on IRS.gov (Rule 2).*

### `notes`
Array of short free-text strings for anything material that doesn't fit
the schema (e.g., "Form 8582 shows $0 allowed due to MAGI"). No PII.

## Delivery

Name the file `prior-year-carryovers-<tax_year>.json`. It will be placed
in the repo's gitignored `analysis/` folder and validated by
`validate_prior_year.py`; PII or schema violations are returned with
exact JSON paths for correction.
